Q: Why do I receive an error when installing the package anytime?
A: The installation of package anytime might require the manual installation of the BH-package. The current install_R_packages version automatically requires the BH-package installation. The error should therefore no longer occur.


Q: Why do I receive the error "413 Request Entity too large"?
A: R seems to be unable to process the data with the alloted memory. You can check the memory available to R with the "gc()" command. Your FHIR-Server settings might also prohibit larger request-bodys (may be limited to 1MB). This can be adjusted via "client_max_body_size 100M"


Q: The Script throws an error when trying to apply parameters rm_tag and stop_on_error, how can I fix this?
A: You might have installed an older version of the fhircrackr-package, which does not yet support these parameters. This might be due to enviroment- or server-settings. Check your fhircrackr version (using sessionInfo()) and install the current version.
